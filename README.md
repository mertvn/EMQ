# Eroge Music Quiz

No, all-ages VNs aren't excluded.
Eroge = Visual Novel.
Name was chosen as such for different reasons (mainly browser autocomplete).

## TODO
* Restart songs on results phase option
* User-changeable room settings
* Proper authentication/authorization
* CSS... (help!)
* less clunkier Auto-complete (might need to use JS libraries or write something custom)
* player left room event
* restore state on page refresh
* auto-generate autocomplete list
* coop: ability to click teammate's answer to switch to it
* coop: team answers should be determined by count
* QuizLog
* trim before autocomplete
* 6+ players everything stretching
* rejoining player double losing lives
* quiz continuing after lives = 0 rarely (ghost player with >0 lives?)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event
* previous song playing instead of the new song when the phase change message to the results phase is not received due to a disconnect
